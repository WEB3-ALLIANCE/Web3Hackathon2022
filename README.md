Web 3.0 SEA Alliance announce Web 3.0 Hackathon to jumpstart innovation and ideation for the coming internet revolution


- US$92,000 in prizes in total; top prize of US$25,000
- Opportunity to influence the course of Internet history

The Web 3.0 SEA Alliance, an initiative by Web3 Scholarship, ABGA, FBG Capital, Sanctor Capital and Spark Digital Capital, is calling all indie developers and teams to throw their hat in to the Web 3.0 Hackathon challenge.

### The decentralized internet

Web 3.0 promises to be an evolutionary leap forward that the internet needs, democratizing ownership of personal data on one hand, increasing transparency of its usage by organizations on the other and yet also fortifying the protection of it.

Web 3.0 works by gathering a group of technology stacks, including blockchain infrastructure layer (P2P network stack, State Transition Machine), protocol layer (API services, data aggregation) and dApps (DeFi, GameFi, DAO, user interface).

### Beyond boundaries

On top of the profound implications of its underlying infrastructure that is blockchain, there are yet other experiential empowering transformations that Web 3.0 will usher in:

- Semantic web, where web technologies decode meaning and emotions for a richer internet experience
- Artificial intelligence, where thinking machines remove all the biases of human beings to give you unfiltered results
- Spatial web and 3D, where the lines between the physical and the digital worlds are blurred
- Ubiquity, where the Internet will leave its traditional abodes to be anywhere and everywhere

There are literally no boundaries on what’s possible at Web 3.0 hackathon.

### Change the world

These are all industry-transforming, and you have an opportunity to play a part in it – to accelerate the changes that are coming.
Don’t let the future go by without you having your say on it.

**Entry Eligibility**: All indie developers and teams who are passionate about and willing to contribute to Web 3.0.


Developers can also bounce off their ideas and brainstorm further at the Web 3.0 Hackathon Discord portal.
